# Test Fixtures

Realistic mockups and reference documents for integration testing.

## Files

- `mockup-login.md`: Login screen mockup with UI elements and behavior
- `mockup-dashboard.md`: Dashboard screen mockup with layout and components
- `reference-architecture.md`: System architecture reference with state, events, components

## Usage

These fixtures are used in integration tests to validate the full pipeline:
- Pass 0 extracts components/contracts from these documents
- Pass 1 generates stories based on mockups
- Pass 2 maps UI terms to components from reference docs
