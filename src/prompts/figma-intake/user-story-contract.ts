export const USER_STORY_CONTRACT = `USER STORY CONTRACT (GLOBAL – MUST BE OBEYED)

A user story in this system is a human-facing description of user-visible behavior.

Primary audience:
- Designers and QA reviewing behavior without reading code.

A user story MUST:
- Describe what users see, do, or experience.
- Use plain, accessible language.
- Avoid internal system concepts.

A user story MUST NEVER:
- Reference internal identifiers, states, events, props, or schemas.
- Explain implementation details.
- Read like API documentation or test scripts.

Technical details may exist ONLY in a clearly separated "Technical Reference" section.

If any step introduces technical language into user-facing sections,
it must be moved or removed.`;
