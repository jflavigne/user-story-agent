    "Every in-scope component has at least one primary frame asset (A-###) that clearly shows the component in context.",
    "Each asset has a corresponding INDEX.md entry with: assetId, canonicalComponent, type, source (Figma URL), whatItConfirms, and confidence.",
    "All story claims that depend on visuals cite at least one assetId in an \"Evidence Notes\" (or equivalent) section.",
    "Text labels and key UI affordances (buttons, inputs, toggles, links) are readable in the primary frame; if not, a closeup asset exists and is cited.",
    "If the component includes overlays (modal/sheet/drawer/dropdown), an \"overlay-open\" asset exists and is cited for behaviors/states that require it.",
    "When multiple variants/states are relevant (default/hover/focus/disabled/error/loading), evidence includes either a variant-set asset or separate assets; otherwise the story marks the state as Unknown rather than inventing it.",
    "Canonical component naming is consistent across INDEX.md, filenames, and stories; ambiguous naming is resolved with a layers snapshot or explicitly marked as Inferred.",
    "No duplicate assets for the same purpose: if a newer version exists, it is stored as v2 and the reason/date is noted; stories reference the intended version.",
    "All sources point to the exact node or file location in Figma (node links preferred); broken/denied sources are logged with the failure class and fallback evidence is explicitly labeled.",
    "Security hygiene holds: no tokens/credentials are stored or echoed; evidence does not include unnecessary private comments or personal data."
