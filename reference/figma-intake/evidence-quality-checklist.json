    "Every in-scope component has at least one primary frame asset (A-###) that shows the component in context and is marked Readable; if not readable, it is treated as map-only and not used for extraction.",
    "Each asset has a corresponding INDEX.md entry with: assetId, canonicalComponent, type (map/frame/closeup/overlay-open/variant/layers/tile), purpose, source (Figma node link preferred), imageRef, confidence (Confirmed/Inferred/Unknown), and readability (Readable/Not readable).",
    "All story claims that rely on visuals cite at least one assetId in an \"Evidence Notes\" (or equivalent) section, with claim tags (Confirmed/Inferred/Unknown).",
    "Text labels and key UI affordances (buttons, inputs, toggles, links) used in requirements are readable in at least one cited asset; if not, a closeup or alternative capture exists and is cited, or the story marks the detail as Unknown.",
    "If the component triggers or lives inside an overlay (modal/sheet/drawer/dropdown), an \"overlay-open\" asset exists and is cited for behaviors/states that require it; if the overlay cannot be captured, the limitation is logged and overlay-dependent details are marked Unknown.",
    "When multiple variants/states are relevant (default/hover/focus/disabled/error/loading/empty/success), evidence includes either a variant-set asset or separate assets; otherwise the story marks the state as Unknown rather than inventing it.",
    "Canonical component naming is consistent across INDEX.md, filenames, and stories; when ambiguous, a layers/inspector snapshot is used to resolve naming/variants, or the name mapping is explicitly marked Inferred with rationale.",
    "Large-board handling is correct: map shots are used only for coverage/navigation; extraction is performed from frame renders, tiles, or closeups that meet the readability gate; no microcopy/control-type assertions are taken from a map shot.",
    "No duplicate assets for the same purpose: if a newer or corrected capture exists, it is versioned (e.g., A-014-v2) with a brief reason/date note; stories reference the intended version explicitly.",
    "All sources point to the exact node or file location in Figma (node links preferred); broken/denied sources are logged with a failure class (permission/token/connector/render) and any fallback user-provided evidence is clearly labeled as fallback.",
    "Confidence discipline holds: any requirement not directly evidenced is tagged Inferred (with reasoning) or Unknown (with an explicit evidence request), never asserted as Confirmed.",
    "Security hygiene holds: no tokens/credentials are stored or echoed; evidence avoids unnecessary private comments, personal data, or sensitive information; any redaction is noted in INDEX.md."
